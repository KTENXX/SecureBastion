# üîê SecureBastion: Azure Security Architecture Simulation

SecureBastion is a personal, hands-on simulation project designed to emulate real-world Azure cloud security architecture practices. It replicates a multi-phase security strategy covering critical areas of Azure infrastructure defense, using CLI, Bicep templates, and markdown documentation ‚Äî all without requiring a paid subscription or portal access.

> **Goal:** To demonstrate practical understanding of cloud security design, implementation, and monitoring in Microsoft Azure ‚Äî aligned with AZ-500 exam domains.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- Simulate and reinforce security best practices in an Azure environment.
- Showcase key concepts in network, identity, data, threat, and monitoring security.
- Create a practical GitHub portfolio project for recruiters and interviewers.
- Gain command-line and IaC fluency (Azure CLI + Bicep) without portal dependency.

## üß± Architecture Overview

The project is divided into **7 key phases**, each representing a core component of Azure cloud security:

| Phase | Domain | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Platform Protection** | Simulated NSGs and Azure Firewall rules via Bicep templates. |
| 2 | **Identity & Access Management** | Role-based access, identity simulation, and RBAC policy mapping. |
| 3 | **Admin Access** | Just-In-Time (JIT) access setup using Bicep and CLI commands. |
| 4 | **Data Protection** | Simulated encryption, key vault usage, and mock DLP alert generation. |
| 5 | **Security Posture Management** | Defender for Cloud simulation, secure score insights, and baseline review. |
| 6 | **Monitoring & Logging** | Diagnostic settings, alert rules, and custom dashboards (simulated). |
| 7 | **Threat Protection & Response** | Mapped MITRE ATT&CK tactics and simulated playbooks + alert responses. |
