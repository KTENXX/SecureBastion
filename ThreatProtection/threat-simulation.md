# SecureBastion - Phase 6: Threat Protection

## Overview
This phase simulates how Microsoft Defender for Cloud detects threats, how alerts are generated, and how threat intelligence is mapped and handled.

## Components Simulated
- Defender for Cloud standard tier (simulated)
- Threat detection alerts (manual logs)
- Vulnerability scans (mocked)
- Baseline security violations
- Alert correlation and response guidance

## Simulation Description
1. We assume Defender for Cloud is enabled at subscription level.
2. Simulate a brute-force attack on SSH port using log artifacts.
3. Create fake Defender alerts using markdown logs.
4. Document remediation steps.

## Purpose
This exercise shows how a cloud security architect builds layered defense, monitors threats, and guides the response process proactively.
